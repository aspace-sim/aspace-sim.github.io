lower bandpass frequency and upper bandpass frequency.

cdb(s,<lower bandpass frequency>,<upper bandpass frequency>)
Sets lower and upper bandwith of CDB object. Transmissions will only be
received from the lower bandpass frequency to the upper bandpass frequency
inclusive. Frequencies must be from 1 to 1000.

cdb(t,<frequency>,<max range in SUs>,<code>,<message>)
Transmits <message> over frequency. If ENCRYPTION attribute is set, the
message is encrypted. <code> is also sent but not encrypted.

ENCRYPTION attribute

Sets the encryption code. Will encrypt all outgoing transmissions with

%1 Player Sender DBref
%2 Object Sender DBref
%3 Object Receiver DBref
&4 SDB Location of Sender
&5 SDB Location of Receiver
